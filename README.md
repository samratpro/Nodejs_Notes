## 1. Introduction to Node.js

- **What is Node.js?**
  - Event-driven, non-blocking I/O model
  - Single-threaded vs. Multi-threaded
  - Why use Node.js? (Performance, scalability)

- **Installing Node.js and npm**
  - Node.js version manager (nvm)
  - Checking versions with `node -v` and `npm -v`
  - Setting up a simple Node.js project (`npm init`)

---

## 2. Core Concepts & Modules

- **Understanding the Event Loop**
  - Callbacks and the event loop mechanism
  - Non-blocking, asynchronous code execution

- **Core Modules**
  - `http`: Create a simple server
  - `fs`: File system operations (read, write, append, delete)
  - `path`: Handling and manipulating file paths
  - `os`: Operating system-related information
  - `util`: Utility functions (promisify, format)
  - `events`: EventEmitter and events handling

---

## 3. Asynchronous Programming

- **Callbacks**
  - Callback functions and error-first callbacks

- **Promises**
  - Creating promises, resolving and rejecting
  - `.then()`, `.catch()` for promise chaining

- **Async/Await**
  - Converting promises to async/await syntax
  - Error handling with try-catch blocks

- **Event Loop and Blocking vs Non-blocking Code**

---

## 4. Working with Files & Streams

- **File System Module (`fs`)**
  - Reading and writing files (`fs.readFile()`, `fs.writeFile()`)
  - File statistics (`fs.stat()`, `fs.lstat()`)
  - Directories and file paths (`fs.readdir()`, `path.join()`)

- **Streams and Buffers**
  - Reading/writing large files using streams
  - Buffer manipulation (e.g., for binary data)

---

## 5. HTTP Server & Client

- **Creating a Basic Web Server**
  - Using `http` to create a web server
  - Handling requests and responses

- **Routing**
  - Basic routing (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Query parameters, URL parameters

- **Sending JSON Responses**
  - Setting headers and content-type
  - Sending JSON from the server to client

---

## 6. Express.js Framework

- **Introduction to Express.js**
  - Why use Express? (Simplified routing and middleware)
  - Setting up an Express app
  - Handling requests and responses in Express

- **Routing in Express**
  - Creating routes (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Route parameters and query strings

- **Middleware in Express**
  - Built-in middleware (`express.static`, `express.json()`, etc.)
  - Custom middleware
  - Error handling middleware

---

## 7. Working with Databases

- **MongoDB with Mongoose**
  - Connecting to MongoDB
  - Schema design and models
  - CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

- **SQL Databases (PostgreSQL/MySQL)**
  - Connecting to databases using `pg` or `mysql` packages
  - Using ORM (e.g., Sequelize for SQL)
  - CRUD operations using SQL queries

---

## 8. Authentication & Security

- **User Authentication**
  - Passport.js for authentication strategies (Local, OAuth, JWT)
  - Implementing session-based authentication

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**
  - Creating and verifying JWT tokens
  - Storing tokens in cookies or local storage

- **Security Best Practices**
  - bcrypt for password hashing
  - Helmet.js for securing HTTP headers
  - CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing)
  - Input validation and sanitization (e.g., using `express-validator`)

---

## 9. Real-time Communication

- **WebSockets & `socket.io`**
  - Real-time bidirectional communication with WebSockets
  - Installing and setting up `socket.io`
  - Creating a real-time chat application
  - Broadcasting and rooms in `socket.io`

---

## 10. Testing & Debugging

- **Unit Testing**
  - Using testing frameworks (`Jest`, `Mocha`, `Chai`)
  - Writing and running unit tests

- **Integration Testing**
  - Testing APIs and database interactions

- **Debugging**
  - Using `console.log()` effectively
  - Node.js debugger and `inspect` flag
  - Debugging in Visual Studio Code

---

## 11. Building RESTful APIs

- **Creating REST APIs with Express**
  - Handling HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)
  - Implementing API endpoints for CRUD operations
  - Setting up API versioning
  - Error handling and validation

- **Data Formatting**
  - Sending and receiving JSON
  - Serializing and deserializing data
  - Pagination, filtering, and sorting

---

## 12. Deployment & Best Practices

- **Environment Variables**
  - Using `.env` files and the `dotenv` package
  - Configuring different environments (development, production)

- **Logging and Monitoring**
  - Using logging libraries (`winston`, `morgan`)
  - Monitoring your application (e.g., with `pm2`)

- **Deployment**
  - Deploying Node.js apps on Heroku, Vercel, or DigitalOcean
  - Setting up a production environment (load balancers, reverse proxies with Nginx)
  - Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines with GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

---

## 13. Advanced Topics (Optional)

- **Microservices Architecture**
  - Splitting apps into small, independent services
  - Communication between microservices (REST, message queues like RabbitMQ)

- **GraphQL with Node.js**
  - Setting up a GraphQL server using `graphql` and `express-graphql`
  - Writing GraphQL queries and mutations

- **Serverless Node.js**
  - Introduction to serverless architecture (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions)
  - Building and deploying serverless functions

---

## 14. Projects to Practice

- Build a RESTful API for a blog, e-commerce site, or task management app
- Create a real-time chat application with WebSockets
- Build a CRUD application with MongoDB or SQL
- Develop an authentication system with JWT
- Set up a project with CI/CD pipeline and deploy it
